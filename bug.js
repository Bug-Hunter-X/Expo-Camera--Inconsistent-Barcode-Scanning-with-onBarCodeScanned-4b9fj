This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` function.  The barcode scanner might fail to detect barcodes, especially in low-light conditions or when the barcode is partially obscured.  The callback function may not be triggered at all, leading to no barcode data being received.  This isn't a common issue, but can be frustrating to debug.  The code below shows the setup; the problem is in the inconsistent behavior of the `onBarCodeScanned` callback.
